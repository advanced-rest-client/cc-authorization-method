# cc-authorization-method

A web component that extends `@advanced-rest-client/authorization-method` to allow to select a client certificate as an authorization method.

The component mixes in `@advanced-rest-client/client-certificates-consumer-mixin` that communicates with the application by using DOM events.
The application has to handle the following events for this element to work:

-   client-certificate-list - requests to list installed certificates
-   client-certificate-insert - request to insert new certificate
-   client-certificate-delete - request to delete installed certificate

Note that `-insert` and `-delete` events are not dispatched by this element but are defined in the mixin interface.

Default storage interface is provided with `@advanced-rest-client/arc-models/client-certificate-model.js` [see implementation](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/arc-models/blob/stage/src/ClientCertificateModel.js).

An UI to manage installed certificates is provided by `@advanced-rest-client/client-certificates-panel`.
